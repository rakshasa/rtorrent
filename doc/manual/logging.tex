\section{Logging}

\subsection{Opening log files}

\begin{verbatim}
# log.open_file = "log name", "file path"

log.open_file = "rtorrent.log", (cat,/tmp/rtorrent.log.,(system.pid))
\end{verbatim}

A newly opened log file is not connected to any logging events.

Some control over formatting will be provided at a later date.


\subsection{Adding outputs to events}

\begin{verbatim}
# log.add_output = "logging event", "log name"

log.add_output = "info", "rtorrent.log"

log.add_output = "dht_all", "tracker.log"
log.add_output = "tracker_events", "tracker.log"
log.add_output = "tracker_requests", "tracker.log"
\end{verbatim}

Each log handle can be added to multiple different logging events.


\subsection{Logging events}

\begin{verbatim}
"critical"
"error"
"warn"
"notice"
"info"
"debug"
\end{verbatim}

The above events receive logging events from all the sub-groups
displayed below, and each event also reciving events from the event
above in importance.

Thus some high-volume sub-group events such as ``tracker\_debug'' are
not part of ``debug'' and every ``warn'' event will receive events
from ``error'', ``critical''.

\begin{verbatim}
"connection_*"
"dht_*"
"peer_*"
"rpc_*"
"storage_*"
"thread_*"
"tracker_*"
"torrent_*"
\end{verbatim}

All sub-groups have events from ``critical'' to ``debug'' defined.
