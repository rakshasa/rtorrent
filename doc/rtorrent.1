.SH NAME
rtorrent \- a BitTorrent client for ncurses
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrtorrent\fR [ \fB-h\fR ] [ \fB-n\fR ] [ \fB-o key1=opt1,...\fR ] [ \fB-O key=opt\fR ] [ \fBURL | FILE\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrtorrent\fR is a BitTorrent client for ncurses, using
the \fBlibtorrent\fR library. The client and library is
written in C++ with emphasis on speed and efficiency, while delivering
equivalent features to those found in GUI based clients in an ncurses
client.
.PP
Most of the options below have their own default unit in addition to
supporting B, K, M and G suffixes.

.TP
\fBload_verbose = \fIfile\fB\fR
.TP
\fBload_start = \fIfile\fB\fR
.TP
\fBload_start_verbose = \fIfile\fB\fR
Load and possibly start a file, or possibly multiple files by using the

to the filename provided.
.TP
\fBimport = \fIfile\fB\fR
.TP
\fBtry_import = \fIfile\fB\fR
Load a resource file. \fBtry_import\fR does not throw
torrent::input_error exception on bad input.

.TP
\fBstop_on_ratio = \fImin_ratio\fB,\fImin_upload\fB,\fImax_ratio\fB\fR
Stop torrents when they reach the given upload ratio
\fBmin_ratio\fR in percent. If the optional
\fBmin_upload\fR is given, require a total

\fBmin_peers = \fIvalue\fB\fR
.TP
\fBmax_peers = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Set the minimum and maximum number of peers to allow in each download.
.TP
\fBmin_peers_seed = \fIvalue\fB\fR
.TP
\fBmax_peers_seed = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Set the minimum nad maximum number of peers to allow while seeding, or
-1 (default) to use max_peers.
.TP

Set the maximum number of simultaneous uploads per download.
.TP
\fBmax_uploads_div = \fIvalue\fB\fR
.TP
\fBmax_downloads_div = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Change the divider used to calculate the max upload and download slots
to use when the throttle is changed. Disable by
setting \fB0\fR\&.
.TP
\fBmax_uploads_global = \fIvalue\fB\fR
.TP
\fBmax_downloads_global = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Max upload and download slots allowed. Disable by

.TP
\fBthrottle_up = \fIname\fB, \fIupload_rate\fB\fR
.TP
\fBthrottle_down = \fIname\fB, \fIdownload_rate\fB\fR
Define secondary throttle and/or set the given upload or download rate. Attach to a download with the d.set_throttle_name=name command
or switch throttles with Ctrl-T. Download must be stopped when changing throttles. Note that secondary throttles only work if the
global upload/download is throttled. Setting a download to use the \fBNULL\fR throttle makes the download unthrottled
even when there is a global throttle. Note that this special case bypasses the global throttle entirely, and as such its rate and
transfer amounts are not included in the global statistics.
.TP
\fBthrottle_ip = \fIname\fB, \fIhost\fB\fR
.TP
\fBthrottle_ip = \fIname\fB, \fInetwork/prefix\fB\fR
.TP
\fBthrottle_ip = \fIname\fB, \fIstart\fB, \fIend\fB\fR
Use the given secondary throttle for a host, CIDR network or IP range. All peers with a matching IP will use this throttle instead
of the global throttle or a custom download throttle. The name may be \fBNULL\fR to make these peers unthrottled, with
the same caveats as explained above.
.SH "TRACKER RELATED SETTINGS"
.PP
Tracker related settings.
.TP
\fBenable_trackers = \fIyes\fB\fR
Set to \fBno\fR to disable all tracker requests. Useful
for disabling rtorrent with the \fBschedule\fR command.
.TP
\fBtracker_dump = \fIfilename\fB\fR
Dump tracker requests to \fBfilename\fR, disable by
supplying an empty string. Only torrents loaded while
\fBtracker_dump\fR contains a non-empty string will be
logged at the moment, although disabling it will work as expected.
.TP
\fBtracker_numwant = \fInumber\fB\fR
Set the numwant field sent to the tracker, which indicates how many
peers we want. A negative value disables this feature.
.TP
\fBuse_udp_trackers = \fIyes\fB\fR
Use UDP trackers. Disable if you are behind a firewall, etc, that does
not allow connections to UDP trackers.
.TP
\fBdht = \fIdisabled|off|auto|on\fB\fR
Support for querying the distributed hash table (DHT) to find peers for trackerless
torrents or when all trackers are down. Set to \fBdisable\fR to completely
disable DHT, \fBoff\fR (default) to enable DHT but to not start the
DHT server, \fBauto\fR to automatically start and stop the DHT server
as needed or \fBon\fR for permanently keeping the DHT server running.
When set to automatic, the DHT server will start up when the first non-private torrent
is started, and will stop 15-30 minutes after the last non-private torrent is
stopped (or when rTorrent quits). For DHT to work, a session directory must be set (for
saving the DHT cache).
.TP
\fBdht_port = \fInumber\fB\fR
Set the UDP listen port for DHT. Defaults to 6881.
.TP
\fBdht_add_node = \fIhost[:port]\fB\fR

.TP
\fBhttp_capath = \fIpath\fB\fR
.TP
\fBhttp_cacert = \fIfilename\fB\fR
Set the certificates to use in http requests. See Curl's
CURLOPT_CAPATH and CURLOPT_CAINFO options for further information.

.TP
\fBview_add = \fIname\fB\fR
Create a new view.
.TP
\fBview_sort = \fIname\fB\fR
.TP
\fBview_sort = \fIname\fB,\fIseconds\fB\fR
Sort a view according the the criteria set by
\fBview_sort_current\fR\&. If the optional argument is

\fBview_sort_new = \fIname\fB,\fI\&...\fB\fR
.TP
\fBview_sort_current = \fIname\fB,\fI\&...\fB\fR
Set the sorting criteria for when new elements inserted or
\fBview_sort\fR is called. The list can contain any
number of criteria, including zero, from the following:

\fBname\fR, \fBname_reverse\fR,
\fBstopped\fR, \fBstarted\fR,
\fBcomplete\fR, \fBincomplete\fR,
\fBstate_changed\fR,
\fBstate_changed_reverse\fR

passing \fB-1\fR\&.
.TP
\fBsplit_file_size = \fIsize\fB\fR
Split files in a torrent larger than \fBsize\fR into
seperate files. Disable by passing \fB-1\fR\&.
.TP
\fBsplit_suffix = \fIstring\fB\fR
Set the suffix used on split files. Defaults

.SH "DOWNLOAD SETTINGS"
.PP
Settings that require a download as a target, the options need to be
called through f.ex \fBon_finished\fR\&.
.TP
\fBcreate_link = \fItype\fB,\fIpath\fB,\fIsuffix\fB\fR
.TP
\fBdelete_link = \fItype\fB,\fIpath\fB,\fIsuffix\fB\fR
Create or delete a symbolic link. The link path is the concatenation
of \fBpath\fR, the result of
the \fBtype\fR on the download,
and \fBsuffix\fR\&.

Available types are; \fBbase_path\fR uses the base path
of the download, \fBbase_filename\fR uses the base
filename of the download, \fBtied\fR uses the path of
the file the download is tied to, see \fBstart_tied\fR\&.
.SH "ADVANCED SETTINGS"
.PP
This list contains settings users shouldn't need to touch, some may
even cause crashes or similar if incorrectly set.
.TP
\fBhash_read_ahead = \fIMB\fB\fR
Configure how far ahead we ask the kernel to read when doing hash
checking. The hash checker uses madvise(..., MADV_WILLNEED) for the
requests.

Interval between attempts to check the hash when the chunk is not in
memory, in milliseconds.
.TP
\fBhash_max_tries = \fItries\fB\fR

be nessesary in case of filesystem bugs like NFS in linux ~2.6.13.
.TP
\fBmax_open_files = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Number of files to simultaneously keep open. LibTorrent dynamically
opens and closes files as necessary when mapping files to
memory. Default is based on sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX).
You probably only think you know what this option does, so don't touch
it.
.TP
\fBmax_open_sockets = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Number of network sockets to simultaneously keep open. This value is
set to a reasonable value based on \fBsysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX)\fR\&.
.TP
\fBmax_open_http = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Number of sockets to simultaneously keep open. This value is set
to \fB32\fR by default.
.TP
\fBmax_memory_usage = \fIbytes\fB\fR
Set the max amount of memory space used to mapping file chunks. This
may also be set using \fBulimit -m\fR where 3/4 will be
allocated to file chunks.

.TP
\fBtos = \fIdefault|lowdelay|throughput|reliability|mincost\fB\fR
.TP
\fBtos = \fIhex\fB\fR
Change the TOS of peer connections, by default set to
\fBthroughput\fR\&. If the option is set to
\fBdefault\fR then the system default TOS is used. A
hex value may be used for non-standard settings.
.TP
\fBhandshake_log = \fIyes\fB\fR
