.SH NAME
rtorrent \- a BitTorrent client for ncurses
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrtorrent\fR [ \fB-h\fR ] [ \fB-n\fR ] [ \fB-o key1=opt1,...\fR ] [ \fB-O key=opt\fR ] [ \fBURL | FILE\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrtorrent\fR is a BitTorrent client for ncurses, using
the \fBlibtorrent\fR library. The client and library is
written in C++ with emphasis on speed and efficiency, while delivering
equivalent features to those found in GUI based clients in an ncurses
client.

Most of the options below have their own default unit in addition to
supporting B, K, M and G suffixes.

options may be specified:

\fBallow_incoming\fR (allow incoming encrypted connections), 
\fBtry_outgoing\fR (use encryption for outgoing connections),
\fBrequire\fR (disable unencrypted handshakes), 
\fBrequire_RC4\fR (also disable plaintext transmission after the
initial encrypted handshake),
\fBenable_retry\fR (if the initial outgoing connection fails, retry
with encryption turned on if it was off or off if it was on), 
\fBprefer_plaintext\fR (choose plaintext when peer offers a choice 
between plaintext transmission and RC4 encryption, otherwise RC4 will be used).
.TP
\fBschedule = \fIid\fB,\fIstart\fB,\fIinterval\fB,\fIcommand\fB\fR

\fBstart\fR and \fBinterval\fR may
optionally use a time format, \fBdd:hh:mm:ss\fR\&. F.ex to

.TP
\fBstop_on_ratio = \fImin_ratio\fB,\fImin_upload\fB,\fImax_ratio\fB\fR
Stop torrents when they reach the given upload ratio
\fBmin_ratio\fR in percent. If the optional
\fBmin_upload\fR is given, require a total
upload amount of this many bytes as well. If the optional
\fBmax_ratio\fR is given, stop the torrent
when reaching this ratio regardless of the total upload
amount. Exclude certain torrent by pressing 
\fBShift+I\fR in the downlist list.
Use with the \fBschedule\fR option.
.TP
\fBload = \fIfile\fB\fR
.TP
\fBload_verbose = \fIfile\fB\fR
.TP
\fBload_start = \fIfile\fB\fR
.TP
\fBload_start_verbose = \fIfile\fB\fR
Load and possibly start a file, or possibly multiple files by using the
wild-card "*". This is meant for use with

\fBstart\fR is non-zero. The loaded file will be tied
to the filename provided.
.TP
\fBimport = \fIfile\fB\fR

Load a resource file. \fBtry_import\fR does not throw
torrent::input_error exception on bad input.

Set to \fBno\fR to disable all tracker requests. Useful
for disabling rtorrent with the \fBschedule\fR command.
.TP
\fBtracker_dump = \fIfilename\fB\fR
Dump tracker requests to \fBfilename\fR, disable by
supplying an empty string. Only torrents loaded while
\fBtracker_dump\fR contains a non-empty string will be
logged at the moment, although disabling it will work as expected.
.TP
\fBtracker_numwant = \fInumber\fB\fR
Set the numwant field sent to the tracker, which indicates how many
peers we want. A negative value disables this feature.
.TP
\fBuse_udp_trackers = \fIyes\fB\fR

not allow connections to UDP trackers.
.SH "USER-INTERFACE SETTINGS"
.PP
Display related settings.
.TP

\fBview_sort = \fIname\fB\fR
.TP
\fBview_sort = \fIname\fB,\fIseconds\fB\fR

\fBview_sort_current\fR\&. If the optional argument is
supplied, the view is not sorted if a change happened during the last
\fBseconds\fR\&. This command is meant to be used with
\fBschedule\fR\&.
.TP
\fBview_sort_new = \fIname\fB,\fI\&...\fB\fR
.TP
\fBview_sort_current = \fIname\fB,\fI\&...\fB\fR
Set the sorting criteria for when new elements inserted or
\fBview_sort\fR is called. The list can contain any
number of criteria, including zero, from the following:

\fBname\fR, \fBname_reverse\fR,
\fBstopped\fR, \fBstarted\fR,
\fBcomplete\fR, \fBincomplete\fR,
\fBstate_changed\fR,
\fBstate_changed_reverse\fR
.TP
\fBview_filter = \fIname\fB,\fI\&...\fB\fR
Set a list of filter to apply when new new downloads are added and
when \fBview_sort\fR is called. All filters must
match for the download to be included.

\fBstopped\fR, \fBstarted\fR,
\fBcomplete\fR, \fBincomplete\fR,
.TP
\fBkey_layout = \fIqwerty|azerty|qwertz\fB\fR
Change the key-bindings.
.SH "ADVANCED SETTINGS"
.PP

even cause crashes or similar if incorrectly set.
.TP
\fBhash_read_ahead = \fIMB\fB\fR
Configure how far ahead we ask the kernel to read when doing hash
checking. The hash checker uses madvise(..., MADV_WILLNEED) for the
requests.
.TP
\fBhash_interval = \fIms\fB\fR
Interval between attempts to check the hash when the chunk is not in
memory, in milliseconds.
.TP
\fBhash_max_tries = \fItries\fB\fR
Number of attempts to check the hash while using the mincore status,
before forcing. Overworked systems might need lower values to get a
decent hash checking rate.
.TP
\fBsafe_sync = \fIyes|no\fB\fR
Always use MS_SYNC rather than MS_ASYNC when syncing chunks. This may
be nessesary in case of filesystem bugs like NFS in linux ~2.6.13.
.TP
\fBmax_open_files = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Number of files to simultaneously keep open. Libtorrent dynamically
opens and closes files when mapping files to memory. Defaults to 128.
.TP
\fBmax_open_sockets = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Number of sockets to simultaneously keep open. This value is set to be
\fBsysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX) - 256\fR at startup. This
gives the client 128 sockets to use as it wishes.
.TP
\fBmax_memory_usage = \fIbytes\fB\fR
Set the max amount of memory space used to mapping file chunks. This
may also be set using \fBulimit -m\fR where 3/4 will be
allocated to file chunks.
.TP
\fBsend_buffer_size = \fIvalue\fB\fR
.TP
\fBreceive_buffer_size = \fIvalue\fB\fR
Adjust the send and receive buffer size for socket.
.TP

Changes the working directory of the process using
\fBchdir\fR\&.
.TP
\fBsession_on_completion = \fIyes\fB\fR
Controls if the session torrent is saved when a torrent finishes. By
default on.
.TP
\fBsession_lock = \fIyes\fB\fR
Controls if a lock file is created in the session directory on startup.
.TP
\fBsession_save = \fR
Save the session files for all downloads.
.TP
\fBtos = \fIdefault|lowdelay|throughput|reliability|mincost\fB\fR
.TP
\fBtos = \fIhex\fB\fR
Change the TOS of peer connections, by default set to
\fBthroughput\fR\&. If the option is set to
\fBdefault\fR then the system default TOS is used. A
hex value may be used for non-standard settings.
.TP
\fBhandshake_log = \fIyes\fB\fR
Enable logging of the peer handshake. This generates a large number of
log messages, but may be useful to debug connection problems.
