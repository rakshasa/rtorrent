Logging
=======

Opening Log Files
-----------------

```
# log.open_file = "log name", "file path"
log.open_file = "rtorrent.log", (cat,/tmp/rtorrent.log.,(system.pid))  
```

A newly opened log file is not connected to any logging events.

Some control over formatting will be provided at a later date.

Adding outputs to events
------------------------

```
    # log.add_output = "logging event", "log name"

    log.add_output = "info", "rtorrent.log"

    log.add_output = "dht_debug", "tracker.log"
    log.add_output = "tracker_debug", "tracker.log"
```

Each log handle can be added to multiple different logging events.

Logging events
--------------

```
    "critical"
    "error"
    "warn"
    "notice"
    "info"
    "debug"
```

The above events receive logging events from all the sub-groups
displayed below, and each event also receives events from the event
above in importance.

Thus some high-volume sub-group events such as “tracker\_debug” are not
part of “debug” and every “warn” event will receive events from “error”,
“critical”.

    "connection_*"
    "dht_*"
    "peer_*"
    "rpc_*"
    "storage_*"
    "thread_*"
    "tracker_*"
    "torrent_*"

All sub-groups have events from “critical” to “debug” defined.
