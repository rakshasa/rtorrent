// A simple, and not guaranteed atomic, lockfile implementation. It
// saves the hostname and pid in the lock file, which may be accessed
// by Lockfile::locked_by(). If the path is an empty string then no
// lockfile will be created when Lockfile::try_lock() is called, still
// it will set the locked state of the Lockfile instance.
